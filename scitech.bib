abstract = {Shape estimation is one of the key aspects of recent space situational awareness (SSA) research efforts. Much SSA work is focused on characterizing space objects through estimation of attitude, rotation rate, area/shape, and then to extrapolate object type, mission, and operational status. This paper presents an initial investigation of using photometric data with a lightcurve inversion technique commonly used for asteroid shape estimation, to approximate the shape of man-made objects in the geosynchronous belt (GEO). Specifically, this paper uses simulated photometric observations of a an upper stage rocket body, a high area-to-mass ratio (HAMR) object, 1U and 3U CubeSats, as well as a box-wing satellite taken from a space-based optical sensor to assess the feasibility of this lightcurve inversion method. Results indicate it is a beneficial technique for rocket bodies and CubeSats, while showing only moderate difficulties with HAMR objects and box-wing shapes. Suggestions for algorithm improvements and future work are included.},

abstract = {In Part I of this paper we developed the theory and algorithms for performing Shape-From-Silhouette (SFS) across time. In this second part, we show how our temporal SFS algorithms can be used in the applications of human modeling and markerless motion tracking. First we build a system to acquire human kinematic models consisting of precise shape (constructed using the temporal SFS algorithm for rigid objects), joint locations, and body part segmentation (estimated using the temporal SFS algorithm for articulated objects). Once the kinematic models have been built, we show how they can be used to track the motion of the person in new video sequences. This marker-less tracking algorithm is based on the Visual Hull alignment algorithm used in both temporal SFS algorithms and utilizes both geometric (silhouette) and photometric (color) information. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

abstract = {Establishing the abundance and physical properties of regolith and boulders on asteroids is crucial for understanding the formation and degradation mechanisms at work on their surfaces. Using images and thermal data from NASA's Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) spacecraft, we show that asteroid (101955) Bennu's surface is globally rough, dense with boulders, and low in albedo. The number of boulders is surprising given Bennu's moderate thermal inertia, suggesting that simple models linking thermal inertia to particle size do not adequately capture the complexity relating these properties. At the same time, we find evidence for a wide range of particle sizes with distinct albedo characteristics. Our findings imply that ages of Bennu's surface particles span from the disruption of the asteroid's parent body (boulders) to recent in situ production (micrometre-scale particles).},

abstract = {Context. Apart from a few targets that were directly imaged by spacecraft, remote sensing techniques are the main source of information about the basic physical properties of asteroids, such as the size, the spin state, or the spectral type. The most widely used observing technique-time-resolved photometry-provides us with data that can be used for deriving asteroid shapes and spin states. In the past decade, inversion of asteroid lightcurves has led to more than a hundred asteroid models. In the next decade, when data from all-sky surveys are available, the number of asteroid models will increase. Combining photometry with, e.g., adaptive optics data produces more detailed models. Aims. We created the Database of Asteroid Models from Inversion Techniques (DAMIT) with the aim of providing the astronomical community access to reliable and up-to-date physical models of asteroids-i.e., their shapes, rotation periods, and spin axis directions. Models from DAMIT can be used for further detailed studies of individual objects, as well as for statistical studies of the whole set. Methods. Most DAMIT models were derived from photometric data by the lightcurve inversion method. Some of them have been further refined or scaled using adaptive optics images, infrared observations, or occultation data. A substantial number of the models were derived also using sparse photometric data from astrometric databases. Results. At present, the database contains models of more than one hundred asteroids. For each asteroid, DAMIT provides the polyhedral shape model, the sidereal rotation period, the spin axis direction, and the photometric data used for the inversion. The database is updated when new models are available or when already published models are updated or refined. We have also released the C source code for the lightcurve inversion and for the direct problem (updates and extensions will follow). {\textcopyright} ESO, 2010.},

This paper concentrates on shape determination. The recovered shapes are general and not based on modifications of any prior shape model. We produce test lightcurves of various nonconvex bodies with a fast ray-tracing algorithm. We show that the use of positive definite quantities effectively removes the apparent ill-posedness of the problem. Our methods can obtain convex hulls even for strongly nonconvex objects; major concavities can also be resolved. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

Simulations and real data indicate that the result obtained with convex inversion is unique and stable if several lightcurves obtained at various geometries are available. Since the parameters of scattering laws such as the Hapke or Lumme-Bowell models cannot be determined well using lightcurves only, we introduce a simple empirical scattering law. This law can be applied in the computation of reference lightcurves and phase curves for further analysis of the physical properties of the surface.

abstract = {The goal of the OSIRIS-REx mission is to return a sample of asteroid material from near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu. The role of the navigation and flight dynamics team is critical for the spacecraft to execute a precisely planned sampling maneuver over a specifically selected landing site. In particular, the orientation of Bennu needs to be recovered with good accuracy during orbital operations to contribute as small an error as possible to the landing error budget. Although Bennu is well characterized from Earth-based radar observations, its orientation dynamics are not sufficiently known to exclude the presence of a small wobble. To better understand this contingency and evaluate how well the orientation can be recovered in the presence of a large 1∘ wobble, we conduct a comprehensive simulation with the NASA GSFC GEODYN orbit determination and geodetic parameter estimation software. We describe the dynamic orientation modeling implemented in GEODYN in support of OSIRIS-REx operations and show how both altimetry and imagery data can be used as either undifferenced (landmark, direct altimetry) or differenced (image crossover, altimetry crossover) measurements. We find that these two different types of data contribute differently to the recovery of instrument pointing or planetary orientation. When upweighted, the absolute measurements help reduce the geolocation errors, despite poorer astrometric (inertial) performance. We find that with no wobble present, all the geolocation requirements are met. While the presence of a large wobble is detrimental, the recovery is still reliable thanks to the combined use of altimetry and imagery data.},
